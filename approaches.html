									<h3 class="major">Finding Popular Coupons</h3>
									<p>In order to predict which coupons would be popular in the future, we had to determine which ones had been popular in the past. We counted up the number of purchases for each coupon in the training data, and categorized them by popularity, with 17 different categories. Using a Naive Bayes Classifier, we would predict the popularity of other coupons based on their attributes. We initially thought a k-nearest neighbors classifier would be the most appropriate, but after trying that against a few other classifiers we determined that it was less effective than we expected.</p>


									<h3 class="major">Recommending Coupons</h3>
									<p>We could determine a few things about users by past coupon purchases, but some had very little history on the site. For users with no information from either their reported location or past purchases, we simply recommended coupons that we predicted to be popular. In cases where we had past purchases, we looked at their location by prefecture and small area as well as the genre of coupon they bought most frequently. We could then recommend the most popular coupons in those more specific subsections of the coupon area.</p>
