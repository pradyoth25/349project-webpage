									<h3 class="major">Data Set</h3>
									<p>The data we used was gathered from ponpare.jp, a Japanese coupon website, over the course of a year. Over that year, 22,873 users' transactions were tracked, with 19,413 possible coupons to purchase. The sheer size of the dataset directed our approach. We also had to translate some of the columns from Japanese to Enlish to make sure we could understand all of the data and the effect it had on our results. The Kaggle competition site is available below.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Recommender Systems</h3>
									<p> Recommender Systems produce a list of recommendations in one of two ways
									<ul>
										<li>Collaborative and Content Based Filtering</li>
										<li>Personality based approach</li>
									</ul>
									Collaborative Filtering approaches building the model based on user's past behavior (previously purchased items and/or numerical ratings given to items) as well other similar decisions made by users. And the model is used to predict items the user may have an interest in.

									<h3 class="major">Why is this Important?</h3>
									<p>Recommender systems are used to improve customer experience on a variety of websites. It allows the site to primarily show results that are based on past browsing or purchasing history. This helps customers find products they may enjoy as well as limiting their exposure to products they don't want to see. In this instance, the past coupon purchases of each customer are provided to aid in our predictions.</p>
