									<h3 class="major">Context</h3>
									<p>The accuracy of this kind of recommender tends to be very low. Although we recommended ten coupons for every user, many of them likely did not purchase a full ten during the test period. In addition, there are a very large number of possible coupons, often looking very similar across many attributes of our given data.</p>


									<h3 class="major">Algorithms</h3>
									<p>A Naive Bayes classifier was used to predict the popularity of coupons, as it had the best results with the training data, getting 31.065% popularity correct, whereas the J48 decision tree predicted 29.475% of popularity categories correctly. Naive Bayes was useful because we believe that the attributes of the data are largely independent from each other.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Final Results and Future Work</h3>
									<p>After building our model and recommending coupons, we got an accuracy of .576% on our test data. While this was lower than we would have liked, it is within the range of results achieved by others on Kaggle.</p>
									<p>If we continued to work on this project, we would like to try some feature creation from the available data. Unfortunately, since the dataset is so large, if we had added many more attributes to it the algorithms would have taken much longer to run. Most of the top scorers on Kaggle reported run times of between 6 and 24 hours, which would have allowed us less flexibility to try out different approaches.</p>
